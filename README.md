# Publish-to-ROBLOX
Publishes assets to Rōblox using a command-line interface.  **You may download the executable [here](https://github.com/Windows81/Publish-to-ROBLOX/raw/master/Publish-to-ROBLOX/bin/Debug/Publish-to-ROBLOX.exe).**

*Cookies may be required.*
## Usage
This program takes three command-line arguments.  The first parameter is a path to the file you wish to publish.  Places should be exported as `.rbxl` or `.rbxlx`, whilst plugins/models take in `.rbxm` or `.rbxmx` files.  The second parameter is the asset ID on Rōblox you wish to save to.  The third argument is a `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie that is assigned to the account who owns the item.
### Example
```console
"Publish-to-ROBLOX.exe" "file.xml" 1818 "_|WARNING:-DO-NOT-SHARE-THIS ..."
```
